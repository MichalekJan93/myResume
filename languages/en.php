                    <p>Hi, <br /><br />
                    i&apos;m an avid self-taught front-end web developer and programming has been a passion of mine since high school. For the last year and a half, I have been actively learning front-end programming in JavaScript, TypeScript, and recently I immersed myself in React and React native, in which I would like to create web and mobile applications in the future. <br /><br /> In order to improve my programming skills, I am currently completing a web application developer retraining course at <a href="https://www.itnetwork.cz/">ITNetwork</a> and also to have at least some paper in hands. After working in the electrical field, I am looking for my first job opportunity as a front-end junior programmer.
                    <br /><br />
                    For a better presentation, I have prepared a sample of my work for you. I designed a simple web application with basic functions and SQL database management for the insurance industry. It is a single-page application that uses vanilla JS for all work with the DOM. You can also find the application code on my <a href="https://github.com/MichalekJan93/insurance-app" >GitHubu</a>.
                    <a href="https://www.michalekjan.cz/insuranceApp/" class="js-app">SAMPLE</a>
                    If I have interested you at least a little bit, please contact me. I would very much like to meet with you.</p>
